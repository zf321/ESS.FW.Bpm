    /// <summary>
    ///     Enables customization of variable and property resolution behavior for EL expression evaluation.
    ///     While evaluating an expression, the ELResolver associated with the ELContext is consulted to do
    ///     the initial resolution of the first variable of an expression. It is also consulted when a . or
    ///     [] operator is encountered, except for the last such operator in a method expression, in which
    ///     case the resolution rules are hard coded.
    ///     For example, in the EL expression ${employee.lastName}, the ELResolver determines what object
    ///     employee refers to, and what it means to get the lastName property on that object.
    ///     Most methods in this class accept a base and property parameter. In the case of variable
    ///     resolution (e.g. determining what employee refers to in ${employee.lastName}), the base parameter
    ///     will be null and the property parameter will always be of type String. In this case, if the
    ///     property is not a String, the behavior of the ELResolver is undefined.
    ///     In the case of property resolution, the base parameter identifies the base object and the
    ///     property object identifies the property on that base. For example, in the expression
    ///     ${employee.lastName}, base is the result of the variable resolution for employee and property is
    ///     the string "lastName". In the expression ${y[x]}, base is the result of the variable resolution
    ///     for y and property is the result of the variable resolution for x.
    ///     Though only a single ELResolver is associated with an ELContext, there are usually multiple
    ///     resolvers considered for any given variable or property resolution. ELResolvers are combined
    ///     together using <seealso cref="CompositeELResolver" />s, to define rich semantics for evaluating an
    ///     expression. For the <seealso cref=".getValue(ELContext, Object, Object)" />,
    ///     <seealso cref=".getType(ELContext, Object, Object)" />,
    ///     <seealso cref=".setValue(ELContext, Object, Object, Object)" />
    ///     and <seealso cref=".isReadOnly(ELContext, Object, Object)" /> methods, an ELResolver is not responsible for
    ///     resolving all possible (base, property) pairs. In fact, most resolvers will only handle a base of
    ///     a single type. To indicate that a resolver has successfully resolved a particular (base,
    ///     property) pair, it must set the propertyResolved property of the ELContext to true. If it could
    ///     not handle the given pair, it must leave this property alone. The caller must ignore the return
    ///     value of the method if propertyResolved is false.
    ///     The <seealso cref=".getMemberInfos(ELContext, Object)" /> and
    ///     <seealso cref=".getCommonPropertyType(ELContext, Object)" /> methods are primarily designed for design-time
    ///     tool support, but must handle invocation at runtime as well. The java.beans.Beans.isDesignTime()
