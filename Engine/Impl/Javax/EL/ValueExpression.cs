    ///     An Expression that can get or set a value. In previous incarnations of this API, expressions
    ///     could only be read. ValueExpression objects can now be used both to retrieve a value and to set a
    ///     value. Expressions that can have a value set on them are referred to as l-value expressions.
    ///     Those that cannot are referred to as r-value expressions. Not all r-value expressions can be used
    ///     as l-value expressions (e.g. "${1+1}" or "${firstName} ${lastName}"). See the EL Specification
    ///     for details. Expressions that cannot be used as l-values must always return true from
    ///     isReadOnly(). The <seealso cref="ExpressionFactory#createValueExpression(ELContext, String, Class)" />
    ///     method can be used to parse an expression string and return a concrete instance of
    ///     ValueExpression that encapsulates the parsed expression. The <seealso cref="FunctionMapper" /> is used at
    ///     parse time, not evaluation time, so one is not needed to evaluate an expression using this class.
    ///     However, the <seealso cref="ELContext" /> is needed at evaluation time. The <seealso cref="#getValue(ELContext)" />
    ///     ,
    ///     <seealso cref="#setValue(ELContext, Object)" />, <seealso cref="#isReadOnly(ELContext)" /> and
    ///     <seealso cref="#getType(ELContext)" /> methods will evaluate the expression each time they are called. The
    ///     <seealso cref="ELResolver" /> in the ELContext is used to resolve the top-level variables and to determine
    ///     the behavior of the . and [] operators. For any of the four methods, the
    ///     <seealso cref="ELResolver#getValue(ELContext, Object, Object)" /> method is used to resolve all properties
    ///     up to but excluding the last one. This provides the base object. At the last resolution, the
    ///     ValueExpression will call the corresponding
    ///     <seealso cref="ELResolver#getValue(ELContext, Object, Object)" />,
    ///     <seealso cref="ELResolver#setValue(ELContext, Object, Object, Object)" />,
    ///     <seealso cref="ELResolver#isReadOnly(ELContext, Object, Object)" /> or
    ///     <seealso cref="ELResolver#getType(ELContext, Object, Object)" /> method, depending on which was called on
    ///     the ValueExpression. See the notes about comparison, serialization and immutability in the
    ///     <seealso cref="Expression" /> javadocs.
